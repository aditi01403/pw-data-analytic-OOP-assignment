        "Question 1. What are the five key concepts of object oriented programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around the concept of organizing software design around objects. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation:\n",
        "Encapsulation involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called an object. It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components to protect data integrity and maintain a clear boundary between the object's internal state and external interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a class Car, attributes like speed and methods like accelerate() are encapsulated within the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstraction:\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on exposing only the essential details of an object while hiding unnecessary implementation details. This simplifies the interface for interacting with objects and allows users to work with high-level concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A Vehicle class might define a method startEngine(), but the specific implementation (e.g., electric or combustion engine) is hidden.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance:\n",
        "Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class), promoting code reuse and hierarchical classification. This helps in creating a logical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class, gaining its properties (like wheels) and behaviors (like move()).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows methods in different classes to have the same name but behave differently based on the object calling them. It is achieved through method overriding (runtime) and overloading (compile-time, in some languages).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A draw() method in a Shape class can be implemented differently in derived classes like Circle, Square, or Triangle.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Composition:\n",
        "Composition is a design principle where objects are built from other objects. Instead of using inheritance to achieve functionality, composition involves using instances of other classes as part of a new class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A Car class can have objects of Engine, Wheel, and Transmission classes as its components.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These principles collectively provide a robust framework for designing modular, scalable, and maintainable software systems."
